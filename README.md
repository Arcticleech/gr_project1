Game Review Project 

In this project, i will set up a database that will hold two tables, one for Games, and the other for Reviews. 

In the games table, it will hold a unique id for the game added, then brief information about the game:
ID, name, genre, release date and age rating

In the Review table, there will be an id for the input of review, a space to create a review on the game:
ID, ID tied to game ID, name, personal rating 1/10, pros' and cons'.

The navigation of the tables will be straight-forward and easily readable on the game which you select.

It will offer you to pick a game, add a game or remove a game. In the reviews table, you will be able to add your own review and see others reviews.
You will also be able to sort the games in rating order to see what was best to worst/vice versa.
